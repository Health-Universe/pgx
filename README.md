# Purpose
This repository will be used to develop a lightweight, clinical decision support system for pharmacogenomics (PGx). 

# Features
- Retrieval of all CPIC recommendations for a specific drug & gene pair. Currently only supports three drugs (simvastatin, abacavir, and codeine)

# Future ideas and features
- Support additional drugs
- Improve readability of recommendations
- Integration of a knowledge model that supports multi-drug and multi-gene decision support
- Integration of demo patient profiles
- Integration with FHIR
